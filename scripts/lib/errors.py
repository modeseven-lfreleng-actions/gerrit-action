"""Domain-specific exception hierarchy for gerrit-action.

All exceptions raised by gerrit-action library modules inherit from
:class:`GerritActionError`, making it easy to catch every anticipated
failure at the CLI entry-point level while still allowing callers to
handle specific categories (Docker, health-check, replication, …)
individually.
